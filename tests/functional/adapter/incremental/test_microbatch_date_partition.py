"""The window is attached to the *upstream* relation, and the refusal of a DATE event column.

Two things the repository had not pinned before, both from the 87422681 investigation:

* where the batch predicate is applied - dbt-core resolves `event_time` on the relation being read
  and wraps *that* one, so a `cast()` inside the microbatch model's own SELECT is applied after the
  window; it does not rescue a DATE-typed upstream column;
* what this adapter does about a DATE event column now. MaxCompute evaluates
  `DATE >= '2025-05-01 00:00:00+00:00'` as NULL rather than raising, so every batch selected zero
  rows and `dbt run` still reported `PASS` with the target empty (measured: `PASS=2`, 0 rows, in
  `Etc/GMT`, `Asia/Shanghai` and `Etc/GMT+8` alike). `mc_validate_microbatch_config` now refuses the
  declared combination instead of letting it look like a successful run.
