"""The clocks a microbatch model depends on, and the profile field that used to move one of them.

A microbatch batch is written by overwriting the partitions its rows fall into, and this adapter
creates those partitions with ``auto partitioned by (trunc_time(<field>, '<granularity>'))``. So
the strategy is only correct while two things read the same clock:

* the batch window. dbt-core renders it as a timestamp string carrying an offset,
  ``event_time >= '2025-05-01 00:00:00+00:00'``, and MaxCompute evaluates that comparison in the
  **session** timezone (measured: `+00:00`, `+08:00` and `-05:00` on the same wall clock all
  produce the same rows, so the offset in the text is not what picks the clock);
* `trunc_time()`, which assigns each row to a partition, and cuts on **UTC**.

What sets the session timezone is the profile: `MaxComputeCredentials._get_odps` writes
pyodps' `options.local_timezone`, and pyodps turns that into the `odps.sql.timezone` session
setting (`Etc/GMT` when it is falsey). With no `timezone` in the profile - the adapter's default -
both clocks are UTC and nothing has to be corrected; `TestMicrobatchDefaultUtcSession` pins that
the rendering on that path is untouched.

`TestMicrobatchProfileTimezone` sets the documented `timezone` field instead. Before the window was
stated on the session clock this combination lost rows in silence: the window was read as local
wall clock while `trunc_time()` kept cutting UTC days, so a "day" window straddled two partitions
and the next window's `insert overwrite` erased rows the previous window had written - with the run
still reporting success. That is the behaviour pinned here, in both directions:

* the assertions are the ones a correct adapter has to satisfy, and they are shared by the two
  cells, so a change that fixes one clock pairing and breaks the other cannot pass silently;
* the fixture rows are built with `from_unixtime()`, whose instant does **not** depend on the
  session. Writing them as `TIMESTAMP'...'` text instead would move the data by the same amount the
  window moves, and the two shifts would cancel each other out: the cell would pass whether or not
  the rendering was aligned.
